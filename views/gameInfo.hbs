       It's 2017, and innovation is at its finest. Technology is exponentially growing; ten-thousand years of progress have been made only in the last century. However, the workforce that is making it happen has not been changing. The tech industry has been pictured as something that it difficult to be a part of. It has been made out to be something minorities can only dream about, but it can happen. With the right work ethic and determination anyone can be a part of the tech world and change it for the better. Your background is not what matters; it's your effort that makes the difference.

       Everything starts off one way, but that doesn’t mean that it is not subject to change. Change isn’t just going to happen suddenly; it’s something that we have to <em>make</em> happen. As the saying goes, “we have to be the change that we wish to see in the world.” There is a beginning to every story. The beginning to the increase in minorities working in the tech field starts with you.

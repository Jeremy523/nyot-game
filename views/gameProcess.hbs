        <p class="toLeft">In the beginning of this internship we decided that we wanted to work on our final project together with the intent of delivering a message to our players as the story progressed. As alumni of New York on Tech (NYOT), we thought it would be best to use a message that would be somewhat collaborate with what NYOT stands for. By creating a game to communicate our message it would help us reach a wider audience because being informed in a fun way is the best way to get people to retain important information.</p>
        <p class="toLeft">When creating the story behind the game it was important for us to create a main character that could be seen as relatable. Our main character is set to be a janitor just to show that it doesn’t really matter what background you have; you can do a lot if you’re determined. The robot, Lang Machine, represents coding and the tech world. The overall message… you’ll have to play the game to find out.</p>

        The development of the map is what makes or breaks a game because without good map design there is not a good game. The placement of all the platforms became the most important piece to make an engaging experience for the player. The placements of the buttons and levers make you think while the game may get progressively harder. I hope you enjoy platforming on a map created to entertain and bring surprises to whoever plays!

          I initially worked along with Jeremy to create the physics of the platformer, which included gravity, the player, platforms, and the interactions between various objects such as collisions. With experience with Java in college and some prior experience with the programming language,
          it was not too difficult for me to understand the concepts to get started and code in javaScript.

          Once all of this was done, I turned my attention to designing a way for the game to be shared with, which ultimately became this website.
          Using Bootstrap, I designed a page where we could share our project and a little bit about ourselves. I took the pictures of the portraits and edited them to fit the style of the page and added a bit of jQuery to make the page responsive to specific window sizes.

          From the beginning of our development process, my focus was solely on the backend of the web app and the mechanics of our game. At the start I worked on the core game mechanics with Kevin. This work consisted of basic player movement, jumping, and collision detection with platforms. 
        </p>
        <p class="toLeft">
          Following this, Kevin shifted focus onto designing the site and I continued work with adding things such as character animation, level scrolling, trampoline platforms, elevator platforms, and the foundation for building levels into the game. Our game and the engine it runs on were created by us using pure HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="toLeft">
          Aside from game mechanics, I also created our Node.js server, used Express to create our web app, and used Handlebars as our templating engine, bringing together our frontend and backend. After all was said and done, I pushed our web app to GitHub and deployed it to Heroku so we can share it with everyone!

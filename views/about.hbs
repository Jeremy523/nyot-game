            Hi there! I am a rising sophomore at the University of Washington in Seattle pursuing a degree in 
            engineering. I play the piano, dance, and am an avid social media user. I like dogs.

          <p>As a student at CUNY Hunter College I learned that it is okay to change your plans. I intended to study Computer Science, but after my first year of college I decided that Computer Science wasnâ€™t for me, so I have been preparing myself to transfer to CUNY Baruch College in order to explore the business aspects of Computer Information Systems.</p>

          <p>
            Hi! I've had a passion for CS and all things software development since I was first introduced to it in my junior year of high school. Since then, I have not stopped working on side projects and trying to learn as much as I can. This fall, I will be transferring as a sophomore student to the Rochester Institute of Technology for my undergrad in computer science.
